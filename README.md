# üß™ Nova Technical Challenge ‚Äì Professional Recommendations

Welcome to my submission for the Nova frontend developer challenge. This repository contains the implementation of a new **Professional Recommendations** feature for a modern professional social network ‚Äî allowing users to recommend one another, similar to LinkedIn.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This feature includes:

- A **User Profile View** displaying:
  - Name, photo, current role and company
  - List of received professional recommendations
- A **Form** to write and submit new recommendations
- A **List of Recommendations** showing:
  - Author info (photo, name, position)
  - Date and content
- **Validation & feedback** for the form (success/error states)

Responsive, accessible and mobile-first by design ‚úÖ

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Styling**: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
